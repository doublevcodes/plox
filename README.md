# Plox

## Greetings from Plox

Plox is a tree-walk interpreter (and soon to be VM Bytecode compiler)
for the Lox programming language created in the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
which is a guide on how to create programming languages. Unfortunately, the code is
in Java and C. Here so my attempt at making it Pythonic.
